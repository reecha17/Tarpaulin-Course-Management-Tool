This is a basic REST API that services as a Course Management Tool used by School Teachers, Administrators, and Students. This project uses Auth0 to validate requests using JSON Web Tokens. There are 13 API endpoints, most of which are protected and require authentication. The API has the basic CRUD operations. There are students and teachers, and they each have courses.

This project was hosted on Google Cloud and uses Datastore as its database management system. This project helped me learn how to use Google Cloud and the capabilities it offers. Datastore is a powerful system that doesn't use SQL which makes pulling data feel easier and more traditional to a programming language.

When writing the API endpoints I wrote in error catching and status codes to return based on successful or unsuccessful requests and which types of unsucessful requests. I tested the enpoints using Newman and POSTMAN. This greatly helped automate sending a lot of different HTTP requests so that I wouldn't have to manually test each one.

Overall I think this project was a great introduction to Cloud. I learned how to deploy projects onto Google Cloud, write and test API endpoints, and implement Auth0 and JWT authentication. I know there is still a lot more to learn about Cloud because of the wide array of tools there are. Next time I would expand the functionalities that my application would have such as an user interface to add more interactivity.
