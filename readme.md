This is a basic REST API that services as a Course Management Tool used by School Teachers, Administrators, and Students. This project uses Auth0 to validate requests using JSON Web Tokens. It has the basic CRUD capabilities that most API's have.

It was hosted on Google Cloud and uses Datastore as its database management system. This project helped me learn how to use Google Cloud and the capabilities it offers. Datastore is a powerful system that doesn't use SQL which makes pulling data feel easier and more traditional to a programming language.

I liked being able to write the API endpoints and testing them using applications like POSTMAN. I learned a lot about how JWTs are assigned and how complicated it can get.
